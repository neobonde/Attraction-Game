## About the jam
The theme of the jam was: "Love is blind!"

The compatition ran for about a week, and in that time participants had to create a game with no predeveloped assets.   
Every asset and script in the repository there for was made from scratch.

Teams were allowed in the jam thus I got help with the music from my roomate Emil.

Software used to develop:
 * [Unity - Game Engine](https://unity3d.com/)
 * [Bosca Ceoil - Music](https://boscaceoil.net/)
 * [sfxr - Sound effects](https://www.bfxr.net/)
 * [Photoshop - Graphics](https://www.photoshop.com/)
